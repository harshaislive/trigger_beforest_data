Journeys that stay with you

Relive the memories from our past events at Beforest Collectives

Not visitors. Not tourists. For a day, your family becomes forest rangers.Set within the 122-acre Beforest Bhopal Collective - a landscape under ecological restoration. This experience unfolds on land once impacted by quarrying and over-extraction, now being carefully regenerated - with rebuilding soil, restoring natural water systems, and bringing back native biodiversity.Bordering the forests of Ratapani Tiger Reserve, people step beyond sightseeing and into participation. Guided by naturalists Dr. Sameer and DP Shrivastava, you move through the landscape with awareness — noticing pugmarks, bird calls, textures, and the lesser known residents of the forest.This is not about chasing wildlife or ticking sightings. It’s about curiosity, shared discovery and relaxed time in the forest!All meals are thoughtfully served outdoors beneath the forest canopy, prepared with fresh, organic ingredients. This is an experience in itself!Breakfast unfolds under open skies, lunch is laid out deep within the woods, and evening snacks arrive at sunset - timed with the landscape turning gold. You dine immersed in the wild, accompanied only by birdsong and shifting light.While the collective lies close to protected forests, every exploration is guided and designed with safety in mind. The day unfolds gently, with time to pause and enjoy the rare luxury of an afternoon nap under the trees. Participants leave feeling enriched, restored, and deeply connected.Limited to just 12 participants, this experience ensures personal attention, unrushed exploration, and meaningful connection - both with nature and with each other.A day that changes how you see forests!

For those who believe coffee is more than a drink - it’s a journey.At our 300+ acre Poomaale Collective in Coorg, coffee is grown the way forests intend - under native shade trees, alongside birds, insects, and wild mammals, within one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world. This is not a plantation visit. It’s a rare chance to step into a landscape where coffee and wilderness exist together.Because farming here is forest-first and slow, biodiversity thrives, and that biodiversity shapes every cup. Soil health, shade, rainfall, fermentation, and time come together to create coffees that are complex, balanced, and deeply rooted in place. This is specialty coffee at its source - unhurried, intentional, and alive.Over the experience, you’ll walk rainforest trails, handpick cherries, explore processing and fermentation, and brew coffee right where it grows. You’ll taste coffees in different stages of their journey while being part of a mesmerizing landscape. Explore waterfalls, hike to Shola grassland and have picnic by the stream!Designed for coffee lovers, slow travellers, couples, and curious families, the Coffee Safari is a rare blend of learning, wilderness, and luxury - where we get access to something most people never get to see.Join the Coffee Safari. Come experience the wild side of specialty coffee

Not a family outing. A return to what family feels like.Across 400+ acres of untouched Coorg wilderness, the rainforests of Poomaale and the open hillsides of Hammiyala - Family Roots invites families to slow down, reconnect, and grow a little wilder together.Even if you’ve visited Coorg before, you’ve never seen forests like these.This isn’t about ticking off activities. It’s about rediscovering each other: through walks that spark wonder, meals that stretch into conversations, and moments that blur the line between learning and play.This special 4-day, 3-night edition of Family Roots spans two of our collectives - the lush rainforests of Poomaale and the open hillsides of Hammiyala, offering families “two distinct sides of Coorg” in one immersive experience. Designed for connection and curiosity, you’ll explore mist-kissed trails, silent grasslands, and thriving ecosystems through expert-facilitated, child-friendly activities: forest walks, nature-art, stream picnics, star-lit evenings, and more. With two nights in Poomaale and a night of gentle, comfortable camping in Hammiyala, families slow down, share stories, and let moments unfold naturally. All consciously designed and gently guided by expert facilitators and naturalists. Here, nothing is random. Everything is designed to nurture a deeper bond with nature, and each other.Here, families slow down, listen closer, and grow a little wilder together.Exclusive to only 6 families. Grow roots, not just memories.

The Jungle Book of Secrets - Fungal Trails In Coorg's post-monsoon, the rainforest transforms into something out of a dream. The ground comes alive with coral-like structures, glowing threads, jelly-like cups, and fungi that seem to breathe with the earth itself. Most of these mushrooms will vanish as suddenly as they appear - some never to be seen again until next year. For naturalists, explorers, and the deeply curious, this is the rainforest at its most mysterious and unrepeatable. Join us for an immersive fungi trail at Poomaale Collective, a 300+ acre rainforest bordering the Brahmagiri Forest Reserve. Set in the Western Ghats, one of the world's great biodiversity hotspots, the forest here feels endless and alive with rare species found nowhere else. Spend two days uncovering a hidden kingdom that sustains the forest itself. Or stay for a third day, where in smaller groups, you'll venture deeper on private walks to seek out the rare and the glowing. This isn't your average nature walk. This is stepping into a world almost no one gets to see. This is the one you'll tell stories about.
