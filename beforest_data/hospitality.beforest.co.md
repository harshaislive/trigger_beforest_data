6 rooms. 128 acres. Infinite quiet. A Kodava-inspired sanctuary where the coffee grows wild and time moves at the speed of nature.

And in the midst of that restoration, we invite you to stay. This is hospitality without the footprint—a way to live with nature, not just look at it. Experiencing the wild, honest and untamed.

The architecture of the Western Ghats is not built; it is grown. The Blyton Bungalow respects this law. Constructed from the earth it stands on, overlooking the canopy, it is a place to sleep with the windows open and wake to the call of the Malabar Whistling Thrush.

The Poomaale Collective, a 300+ acre landscape, nestled in the Brahmagiri foothills encompasses three hillocks and three perennial streams. It is a stellar example of ecological balance and sustainability.

Over 3 years, the estate has conserved an astounding 60 million liters of water and avoided 400 Tons of chemical fertilizers.

Grown with minimal intervention, achieving an unprecedented 90 on a cupping scale—a first for robusta coffee in India.

Home to seven species of woodpeckers, dancing frogs, and the elusive Nilgiri martens.

Beforest is a passionate advocate for conservation, restoration, and sustainability. Our journey is dedicated to rejuvenating landscapes using the concept of collectives—where urban folks join hands to acquire and rehabilitate vast tracts of land.

Wilderness Collective: A collective where the singular agenda is to grow a forest. Using permaculture principles and minimal intervention, we design landscapes to promote biodiversity while setting the path for a harmonious coexistence between nature and humanity.

Today Beforest runs 6 collectives encompassing 1,300 acres of a variety of landscapes from the Deccan Plateau to the Western Ghats, and it all started here at Poomaale.

Where the lines between the living room and the living forest blur.

For those who want to do more than just look. Trek the Western Ghats. Learn the alchemy of coffee. Or simply sit still and let the forest come to you.

The forest has many voices. These are the people who translate them. Storytellers, caretakers, and naturalists who ensure your stay leaves a mark on you, not the land.
